# izzy

Izzy is a fat little sheep living in a 2.5-dimensionial sandbox (or grassbox). She hopes to one day become the main character in her own DOM-based game. To install her:

* clone this repository
* `cd izzy`
* `npm install`
* `gulp build` to compile JS and CSS or `gulp` to watch for SCSS/JS changes
* point your browser to http://localhost:8080 to play with her

Things she can do:

* walk in any direction
* baroo, occasionally

Things she canâ€™t do (yet):

* interact with anything
* talk with anyone
* eat anything
