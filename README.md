# izzy

Izzy is a fat little sheep living in 2.5-dimensionial sandbox (or grassbox). To install her:

* clone this repository
* `cd izzy`
* `npm install`
* `gulp` to watch for SCSS/JS changes and recompile
* view index.html in a browser to play with her

Things she can do:

* walk in any direction

Things she can’t do (yet):

* interact with anything
* talk with anyone
* eat anything

Izzy doesn’t work in every browser. Try Chrome if she’s not behaving. View the current demo [here](http://codepen.io/anon/pen/OVYXjY).
